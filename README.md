# stockMarketSimulator
A program which simulates simplified version of stock market

I made this program to pass a "Programming Basics" course in the first semester of my studies.
The program is made in Java, implements Observer and MVC design patterns.

The program simulates a market with random stocks, which change their price randomly.
The user can buy different shares and then sell them, so that he can grow his wallet or lose everything.
